# GitNav: A version-based git navigator
This package intends to facilitate navigating across a repo's history with the intent of modifying a prior release. An example of this would be backporting a release between major versions, where previously service branches would have been necessary.

_Note: this is my first time using Rust in years, and I was never particularly good. Use with caution!_
